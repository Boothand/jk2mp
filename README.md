# Introduction #
This is the source code of Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi OutCast Multiplayer v1.04. The goal of this source is to be compilable in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (and therefore later versions). The code is cleaned a bit and has some minor fixes.

# Building #
By default it builds 2 applications (.exe): jk2mp and jk2Ded; and 3 dinamic libraries (.dll): cgamex86, uix86 and jk2mpgamex86. It doesn't build QVMs but the code of them is left so it is possible to build them as well.
To build open a solution file (.sln) in CODE-mp folder and then press F7 (Build). It can build both Debug and Release versions without errors.
